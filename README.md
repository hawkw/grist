# grist
a simple Git web service in Rust

Please note that Grist is being developed mostly for educational purposes and will likely lack some of the more advanced features of other self-hosted Git services. If you're actually planning on doing some Real Work, [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [Gogs](http://gogs.io) might be more your speed.
